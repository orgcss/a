aws experiment: connecting private ec2 in two regions (tokyo and ue1)

create peering connection:
in target region:
  default cidr overlapped:
    delete default vpc in ue1: all subnets will be deleted as well.
      delete instances, network interfaces, network gateways first
    create your new vpc, specifing your prefered cidr: however, it can never be the default vpc.
    create your subnets: no default subnets there because you don't have a default vpc.
    create igw, attach to vpc.
    create routtable, attach to vpc, route to igw.
    update subnet public with internet routtable.

in source region:
  create peering connection.
  accept from target region peering connection.
  update routtable with the pcx.
  update routtable in target region.
  
test:
  in target region: create ec2 in private subnet.
  in source region: login ec2, and ssh to target ec2 in target region.
